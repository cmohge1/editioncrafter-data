# Introduction to Github

[Github](https://github.com/) is a hosting platform for software development that utilizes [Git](https://git-scm.com/), the open source system for distributed version control and source code management.

Github allows large-scale and international collaboration on thousands of projects. While Git was originally intended for software development, it can be used in any collaborative working setup where maintenance of versioning is desirable.

The Making and Knowing Project (M&K) has used Github for its versioning capabilities, project management tools, and as a way to share raw data and results openly. \[\[There are three main areas files storage/editing/organization, issue tracking, and project boards.\]\]

## Create am Account

Github is free to use, though there are certain advanced features that are only available behind a paywall. If you have an education email account (i.e., from a university or college), many of these advanced features are made free. Almost all (if not all) of the work we do is possible with a free Github account. 

To get started, create a [Github account](https://github.com/) by signing up. You may want to use your education email account for added features, though this is not necessary. See [Getting started with your GitHub account](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/onboarding/getting-started-with-your-github-account) for more details.

For an introduction of some of the main features of Github, we suggest reviewing [Github's Hello World Exercise](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/hello-world).

## Project Management Tools

There are two main tools M&K has used to help organize and manage its Github activities.

1. The Issue Tracker, found in each repository under the tab "Issues," is a place to help track work in the repository. Most often, an issue is a task or "to do" item, but it can also be used for things like tracking bugs, opening feature requests, or sharing ideas. Fore more information, see [About Issues](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/about-issues).



            -   Take a look at [M&K's repository for Ms. Fr. 640's data](https://github.com/cu-mkp/m-k-manuscript-data) - read through the "read me" (scroll down below the file and directory listings) to get familiar with how we have already worked within Github for our Edition

            -   Skim over [Basic writing and formatting syntax in Markdown](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax). Markdown is the language used throughout Github and, as its name suggests, is a simplified markup language that allows you to style and format text and media, which converts readily to html, but is much easier to pick up and write with. Almost all of the webpages of M&K's Edition are authored in markdown (which you can see in our [Edition Webpages repository](https://github.com/cu-mkp/edition-webpages)).

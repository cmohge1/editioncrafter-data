# Introduction to Github

[[Github]{.underline}](https://github.com/) is a hosting platform for software development that utilizes [[Git]{.underline}](https://git-scm.com/), the open source system for distributed version control and source code management.

Github allows large-scale and international collaboration on thousands of projects. While Git was originally intended for software development, it can be used in any collaborative working setup where maintenance of versioning is desirable.

The Making and Knowing Project has used Github for its versioning capabilities, project management tools, and as a way to share raw data and results openly. \[\[There are three main areas files storage/editing/organization, issue tracking, and project boards.\]\]

The issue tracker served as a project management tool, but also as a place to collaborate, share information, cross-check, document, and record methods of work.

        -   Please also create a Github account (it is free) if you don't have one already and send me your username. See [Getting started with your GitHub account](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/onboarding/getting-started-with-your-github-account) for more details.

        -   Some more advanced preparation if you can:

            -   Take a look at [M&K's repository for Ms. Fr. 640's data](https://github.com/cu-mkp/m-k-manuscript-data) - read through the "read me" (scroll down below the file and directory listings) to get familiar with how we have already worked within Github for our Edition

            -   Skim over [Basic writing and formatting syntax in Markdown](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax). Markdown is the language used throughout Github and, as its name suggests, is a simplified markup language that allows you to style and format text and media, which converts readily to html, but is much easier to pick up and write with. Almost all of the webpages of M&K's Edition are authored in markdown (which you can see in our [Edition Webpages repository](https://github.com/cu-mkp/edition-webpages)).

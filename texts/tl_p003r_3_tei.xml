<head><rs ref="#rs-m">Thick varnish</rs> for planks</head>

<p>There is a <rs ref="#rs-m">varnish</rs> that takes a long time to dry &amp;
drips more than two <rs ref="#rs-tmp">months</rs> after it has been applied to the
planks. But this one does not drip like that of <rs ref="#rs-tmp">times
past</rs>, which was made of <rs ref="#rs-m">linseed oil</rs>, <rs ref="#rs-m">garlic</rs> boiled in it
to extinguish it &amp; rid it of grease, 
&amp; with <rs ref="#rs-m">wheat</rs>. And this one yellowed &amp;
rendered greenish the blue color of paintings. This one is made like the
other one except that one puts <rs ref="#rs-m">coarse common turpentine</rs></p>

<p>instead of <rs ref="#rs-m">fine turpentine</rs>. And you can put into two
<rs ref="#rs-ms">lb</rs> of <del><rs ref="#rs-fr">tou</rs></del> <rs ref="#rs-m">common turpentine</rs> one <rs ref="#rs-ms">lb</rs>
of <rs ref="#rs-m">fine turpentine oil</rs> &amp; do everything as with the other one. This one
will cost you no more than five or six <rs ref="#rs-cn">sous</rs> per
<rs ref="#rs-ms">lb</rs> &amp; is sold for 40 <rs ref="#rs-cn">sous</rs> per
<rs ref="#rs-ms">lb</rs>.</p>

<p>This <rs ref="#rs-tl">vessel</rs> is for making large quantities of
<rs ref="#rs-m">turpentine oil</rs>, that is to say a <rs ref="#rs-ms"><rs ref="#rs-ms">bucket</rs> an
<rs ref="#rs-tmp">hour</rs></rs>, and no matter which <rs ref="#rs-m">turpentine it may be,
whether fine or crude</rs>. One needs to give, as you know, a little
fire at the beginning and always keep <rs ref="#rs-m">cold water</rs> in the cooler
on the top. The <rs ref="#rs-ms">lb</rs> is sold at xii <rs ref="#rs-cn">sous</rs>, &amp;
at the bottom of the <rs ref="#rs-tl">vessel</rs> remains the <rs ref="#rs-m">colophony</rs>, or
<rs ref="#rs-m"><rs ref="#rs-la">pix gr√¶ca</rs></rs>.<comment rid=""/> In this <rs ref="#rs-tl">vessel</rs>, <rs ref="#rs-m">eau-de-vie</rs> is also made well,
and there is no need to distill it again. You
do not need a <rs ref="#rs-tl">oven</rs> for this <rs ref="#rs-tl"><rs ref="#rs-m">copper</rs> vessel</rs>, but
only <rs ref="#rs-m">charcoal</rs> around it if it has a flat bottom, but if it is
round, you will place it on a <rs ref="#rs-tl">trivet</rs>.</p>

<p rend="left-middle">

 It is better to heat the <rs ref="#rs-m">varnish</rs> a little bit, rather than to
put it out <rs ref="#rs-env">in the sun</rs>, because this makes the panel
<rs ref="#rs-po">warp</rs>.</p>

<p rend="left-middle">

 Some say it is not good to distil in this <rs ref="#rs-tl"><rs ref="#rs-m">copper</rs>
vessel</rs> because it makes things green. However, when <rs ref="#rs-m">tinned</rs>, it is
good.</p>

<head>For varnishing</head>

<p><rs ref="#rs-m">Turpentine varnish</rs> does not need any <rs ref="#rs-m">glue</rs> because it
is fatty &amp; viscous &amp; it is not absorbed in the <rs ref="#rs-m">wood</rs> like that
of <rs ref="#rs-m">spike lavender</rs> &amp; <rs ref="#rs-m">sandarac</rs>. Also, that of <rs ref="#rs-m">spike
lavender</rs> does not require any <rs ref="#rs-m">glue</rs> on <rs ref="#rs-m">iron</rs> &amp;
similar things that do not absorb. But on <rs ref="#rs-m">wood</rs> &amp; on colors
which <del>have</del> <add>do not have</add> <rs ref="#rs-m">gum</rs> or 
<rs ref="#rs-m">distemper glue</rs>, it is necessary to lay one coat of the said
<rs ref="#rs-m">hide glue</rs> &amp; to let it dry &amp; to
varnish.</p>

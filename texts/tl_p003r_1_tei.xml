        <p>One needs to first make the branches of <rs ref="#rs-m">wood</rs> or take a bizarre <rs
                ref="#rs-m">thorn branch</rs>, then melt a <rs ref="#rs-ms">lb</rs> of the most
            beautiful <rs ref="#rs-m">clear pitch resin</rs> and put in one <rs ref="#rs-ms"
                >ounce</rs> of <rs ref="#rs-m">subtly ground vermilion</rs> with <rs ref="#rs-m"><rs
                    ref="#rs-pa">walnut</rs> oil</rs>, and if you add in a little <rs ref="#rs-m"
                    ><rs ref="#rs-pl">Venice</rs>
                <rs ref="#rs-fr">laque platte</rs></rs>, the color will be more vivid, and stir
            everything in the <rs ref="#rs-m">resin</rs> melted over a <rs ref="#rs-m">charcoal</rs>
            fire and not of flame, for fear that it catches fire. Next dip in your branches while
            turning, &amp; if any filaments should remain on it, turn the branch over the heat of
            the <rs ref="#rs-m">charcoal</rs>.</p>

        <p rend="left-top" render="tall">
            <rs ref="#rs-df"><rs ref="#rs-m">Colophony</rs></rs> is nothing other than recooked <rs
                ref="#rs-m">resin</rs>. To do it well, take a <rs ref="#rs-tl"><rs ref="#rs-m"
                    >leaded</rs> pot</rs> &amp; melt the <rs ref="#rs-m">resin</rs>, &amp; boil it
            over the <rs ref="#rs-tl">brazier</rs> a good <rs ref="#rs-ms"><rs ref="#rs-tmp"
                    >hour</rs></rs>, &amp; until it appears not to be thick, but clear &amp; liquid
            like <rs ref="#rs-m">water</rs>, &amp; easily runs &amp; flows from the tip of a <rs
                ref="#rs-tl">stick</rs> with which you grind it, &amp; test it. Then pour it through
            a <rs ref="#rs-tl"><rs ref="#rs-m">coarse canvas</rs></rs> or a <rs ref="#rs-tl"><rs
                    ref="#rs-m">very light tammy cloth</rs></rs>, such that when pouring it falls
            into the strongest <rs ref="#rs-m">vinegar</rs> that you can find, for the <rs
                ref="#rs-m">vinegar</rs> gives it strength &amp; prevents it from being so fragile.
            Reiterate this two or three times &amp; it will be beautiful &amp; well purified. For
            counterfeiting your <rs ref="#rs-m">coral</rs>, you can mix a <rs ref="#rs-ms">quarter
                part</rs> of <rs ref="#rs-m">mastic</rs> into your <rs ref="#rs-m">purified
                resin</rs> to render it more firm and more beautiful, &amp; if you were to take a
            single tear of <rs ref="#rs-m">mastic</rs>, it would be all the better, but it would be
            too long. </p>

        <p rend="left-top">
            <rs ref="#rs-m">Sulfur</rs> &amp; <rs ref="#rs-m">vermilion</rs> makes the same
            effect.</p>

        <p rend="top"> The <rs ref="#rs-m">coral</rs> made of <rs ref="#rs-m">gules red enamel</rs>
            endures the <rs ref="#rs-tl">file</rs> and polishing.</p>

        <p rend="right-top"> It is made like <rs ref="#rs-m">cement</rs> that is stronger mixed with
                <rs ref="#rs-m"><rs ref="#rs-tl">pestled</rs>
                <del>than of</del> glass</rs> rather than with <rs ref="#rs-m">brick</rs>. Thus,
            here one mixes well <rs ref="#rs-tl">pestled</rs>
            <rs ref="#rs-m">gules red enamel</rs>, which is red in body, with the <rs ref="#rs-m"
                >vermilion</rs>. Thus with all colors of <rs ref="#rs-m">enamels</rs>.</p>
